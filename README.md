AWS System will send emails grabbing HTML email templates and a list of contacts from an S3 bucket.

Understanding The Components

**AWS Lambda** provides serverless compute capacity to run our application's backend logic. We'll utilize Lambda functions to handle incoming requests, business logic, and communication with other AWS services.

**Amazon S3** is a storage solution for our application that stores static assets such as HTML templates, pictures, and CSV files holding email lists or campaign data.

**AWS SES** (Simple Email Service) allows us to send mass emails to our subscribers. SES offers a dependable and scalable email delivery platform with capabilities such as email validation, bounce handling, and reputation management.

**Amazon EventBridge** enables us to manage and automate workflows by responding to events from various AWS services or custom sources. We'll utilize EventBridge to activate Lambda functions in response to certain events, such as new email subscriptions or campaign scheduling.

----
**1. Set Up AWS Resources**
API Gateway: Create a new API with endpoints for handling email subscriptions, campaign management, and other necessary functionalities.
Lambda Functions: Develop Lambda functions for processing API requests, sending emails, managing campaigns, and handling other business logic.
Amazon S3 Bucket: Create a bucket to store HTML email templates, image assets, and CSV files containing subscriber lists or campaign data.
SES Configuration: Set up SES to verify your domain, configure email sending options, and handle bounce/complaint notifications.
EventBridge Rules: Create EventBridge rules to trigger Lambda functions based on events like new subscriptions, campaign scheduling, or email opens/clicks.
**2. Design the Application Architecture**
**3. Develop Lambda Functions**
Write Lambda function code in your preferred programming language (e.g., Python) to implement the application's backend logic.
**4. Create Email Templates**
Create HTML email templates for your campaigns that include dynamic content placeholders for subscriber names, promo codes, and tailored suggestions. Upload these templates to your S3 bucket so that Lambda functions can easily access them.
**5. Implement API Endpoints**
Configure API Gateway APIs to do a variety of tasks such as subscribing/unsubscribing users, creating/editing campaigns, retrieving subscriber data, and tracking email engagement metrics. Use authentication and authorization techniques to secure these endpoints as needed.
**6. Configure EventBridge Rules**
Configure EventBridge rules to gather important events from API Gateway, SES, S3, and other AWS services. Create a rule that triggers a Lambda function when a new subscriber is added, a campaign is set to run, or an email bounce happens.
**7. Test and Deploy**
Test your application rigorously to confirm that all features work as planned. Use AWS resources such as the Lambda console, API Gateway test console, and SES email sending tests to validate various components. Once you're satisfied, deploy your serverless application to the AWS cloud for production use.


*there might be some time-delays in receiving the email, also it will be sent directly to your spam mailbox since I'm using an unverified domain.
